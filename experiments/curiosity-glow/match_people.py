"""Runs on nick-mel (has the sentence-transformers venv). Reads {members:[{id,name,building,knows}]}
on stdin, returns {nodes, edges, missing, known, suppressed} on stdout.

The curvature engine: TWO distance metrics.
  - idea-space distance  = 1 - cosine(embedding(building_i), embedding(building_j))
  - social distance      = geodesic on the "who already knows whom" graph (knows[])

Carnot's metric, faithfully (same as the doc-graph build_graph.py):
  curiosity(i) = avg(sim to top-K most-similar NON-known) - avg(sim to KNOWN)
A person glows when they are pulled toward idea-twins they are NOT yet connected to.
A *fold* is chord-close (high embedding sim) BUT geodesic-far (not already known) — the
connection the room can't see. Pairs that are both close AND already known are SUPPRESSED.
